## Introduction

This repo was conceived to be used in a bigger project, for a website to help people study and learn new languages and algorithms.

## Features

For now, we are starting with implementations of a few sorting algorithms, but we plan to expand to algorithms related to data structures in the near future.

## Languages and Algorithms

- **C/C++**
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Shell Sort
- **Rust**
  - Quick Sort
- **Python**
  - Quick Sort

## Getting Started

To get started, all you really need to do is clone the repo locally, and the dependencies will be different for each language.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary compilers/interpreters installed:

- [C/C++](https://gcc.gnu.org/): You'll need a C/C++ compiler.
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/): Install Rust using Rustup.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

### Installation

For **C/C++**, you'll need a C/C++ compiler. No additional dependencies are required.

For **Rust**, you can install the Rust compiler using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

For **Python**, make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Clone the repository and navigate to the folder of the language you want to run.


## Usage

- **C/C++**
  - To compile and run the C/C++ code, you can use a C/C++ compiler like GCC or Clang. Navigate to the C/C++ folder and use the following commands:
    ```bash
    g++ -o main main.cpp  
    ./main
    ```

- **Rust**
    - cd into the rust folder and type: 
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
- **Python**
    - cd into the python folder and run: 
    ```bash
     python main.py
    ```
